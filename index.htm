									Many complex systems developed by engineers (e.g. labs on chips, iPads, magnetic resonance imaging scanners, nationwide electrical/gas/oil transportation networks, or buildings/automotive/aircraft frames or supply chains and economical/social networks) or found in nature (e.g. the human cardiovascular system, the brain neural network, biological systems, or the geophysical network of oil/water/gas reservoirs) can be viewed as large collections of interconnected dynamical system components. The performance and characteristics of each individual component critically depend on what engineers or scientists refer to as "second order effects", and can be captured only by resorting to expensive partial differential equation solvers. In addition, components are often affected by random uncertainties in parameters and in geometries. 
									</p>
									<p>
									In this course we will survey several techniques for modeling and simulation of a large variety of engineering and physical complex systems. In particular, depending on the interest of the students attending, topics covered in the course will include:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Recognize and formulate mathematical structures (e.g. conservation laws and constitutive equations) common to a lot of complex dynamical systems</li>
										<li>Select (and modify) or implement an appropriate steady state solver (e.g. sparse LU vs. iterative methods) for a given linear or linearized complex system description</li>
										<li>Select, implement and modify an appropriate strategy to facilitate initialization and convergence of a Newton solver for a given nonlinear complex system</li>
										<li>Select and implement an appropriate technique (e.g. implicit vs. explicit, lower order vs. high order, stable vs. A-stable) for the time domain simulation of a given complex system</li>
										<li>Select and implement an appropriate strategy (e.g. Shooting Newton or Harmonic Balance) for period state analysis of complex systems (e.g. vibrations in mechanical/structural frames, radio frequency circuits, heart beat cycles)</li>
										<li>Select and implement an appropriate strategy to "reduce" automatically models of system components generated by PDE solvers, while preserving input/output accuracy for a range of parameter values, as well as important physical properties</li>
										<li>Select and implement an appropriate strategy to "generate" automatically stable parameterized reduced models of system components from input/output measurements</li>
										<li>Use parameterized reduced order models of system components in order to accelerate optimization, inverse problems in complex systems</li>
										<li>Select and implement uncertainty quantification techniques for stochastic simulation of complex systems affected by random variations in geometries and material properties</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Detailed examples will be presented, drawn from a variety of engineering disciplines e.g. Electrical Engineering (interconnect networks including parasitics; fullwave electromagnetic structures; analog and digital circuits including nonlinear semiconductor devices and Micro-Electro-Mechanical Devices), Mechanical Engineering (frame modeling, heat diffusion, fluid-dynamics and oil transport), Civil Engineering (structural problems, vibrations), Material Sciences (inverse problems for identification of material properties), Biomedical Engineering (biochemical reactions and the human cardio-vascular system).</p>

									Luca Daniel is a Full Professor in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Prof. Daniel received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2003. Industry experiences include in 1998, HP Research Labs, Palo Alto, and in 2001 Cadence Berkeley Labs. Dr. Daniel research interests include development of integral equation solvers for very large complex systems, stochastic field solvers for large number of uncertainties, and automatic generation of parameterized stable compact models for linear and nonlinear dynamical systems. Applications of interest include simulation, modeling and optimization for mixed-signal/RF/mm-wave circuits, power electronics, MEMs, nanotechnologies, materials, MRI machines, and the human cardiovascular system. Prof. Daniel has received the 1999 IEEE Trans. on Power Electronics best paper award; the 2003 best PhD thesis awards from both the Electrical Engineering and the Applied Math departments at UC Berkeley; the 2003 ACM Outstanding Ph.D. Dissertation Award in Electronic Design Automation; 5 best paper awards in international conferences and 9 additional nominations; the 2009 IBM Corporation Faculty Award; the 2010 IEEE Early Career Award in Electronic Design Automation; and the 2014 IEEE Trans. on Computer Aided Design best paper award.
